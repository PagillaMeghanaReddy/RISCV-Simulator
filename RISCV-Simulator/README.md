# CS204-Simulator
This is our project for computer architecture course. The problem statement is to make a simulator to convert assembly language code to machine code. 
The so generated machine code is used to implement a pipelined as well as unpipelined version of the simulator.
We have also added the functionality of caches, i.e. Fully Associative (using LRU), Direct Mapped, and Set Associative.
